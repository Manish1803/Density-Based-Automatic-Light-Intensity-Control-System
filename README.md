# Density-Based-Automatic-Light-Intensity-Control-Syste# Density Based Automatic Light Intensity Control System

A lighting System that adjusts the brightness as per the amount or people at a place.

The core concept is using hall effect sensors to detect the
magnetic field from the devices people carry or magnets
embedded in ID cards, and wrist bands.

The project won the first prize in the E-Ganesha project organized
by the department of E&TC in the second year.

## Advantages

- **Energy Efficient:** With the Density based Automatic light intensity control system, we can ensure we are getting the right amount of light based on the density of people present. This helps to reduce energy usage, resulting in lower electricity bills and a smaller carbon footprint.
- **Improved Safety and Security:** Through this system, the lights are turned ON whenever a person is detected, which allows them to move around safely during the night and there is no need to blindly reach for light switches in the dark.
- **Increase light usage:** Given the automatic dimming functionality of the system, it limits the energy usage for each luminaire, allowing the lights to last longer. This results in fewer replacements needed, and provides environmental benefits too.
- **Good level of convenience:** Having the controls of all the lighting points in large houses and halls is relative, and that is why owners often have to sacrifice massive amounts of energy by leaving lights ON in some parts when they are not needed because it's difficult to go round all the time. However using this system, we have a good level of convenience with the light control being fully integrated into the home/hall.

## Applications

- The Density Based Auto Light Intensity Control System is an energy-efficient way of lighting a room. It provides only a sufficient amount of light by controlling both the number of lights and their intensity.
- This system can be used at
  * **Home Light Systems**
  * **Large halls and Theaters**
  * **Places of public gathering**
It can also be used during festivals (Ganpati, Diwali, etc.) to reduce energy
consumption when there is a high demand and usage of lights

## Future Scope

The implementation that we did was on a scale model and can be extended to a working commercial product. The linear hall sensors can be upgraded to much better omnidirectional sensors which are more sensitive and can detect magnetic field in all directions. Also instead of using just 4 sensors we can increase the sensor count and acquire more accorate data if the sensors are not very sensitive.
## Electronics Required

 - ESP32 Microcontroller/NodeMCU ESP32 (You can use any microcontroller as long as it has a inbuilt ADC)
 - Hall effect sensors
 - Mosfet switch modules
 - USB to TTL converter
 - Wires
